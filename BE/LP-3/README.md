### Machine Learning (ML)

1. Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location. Perform following tasks: <br>
    1. Pre-process the dataset.<br>
    2. Identify outliers.<br>
    3. Check the correlation.<br>
    4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.<br>
    5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc. Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset.

2. Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance. Dataset link: The emails.csv dataset on the Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv

3. Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months. Dataset Description: The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc. Link to the Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling Perform following steps:<br>
1. Read the dataset.<br>
2. Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the data set into training and test sets.<br>
3. Normalize the train and test data.<br>
4. Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same.<br>
5. Print the accuracy score and confusion matrix (5 points).

4. Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the local minima of a function. For example, find the local minima of the function y=(x+3)² starting from the point x=2.

5. Implement K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on diabetes.csv dataset. Compute confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision and recall on the given dataset. Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallamahgoub/diabetes.

6. Implement K-Means clustering/ hierarchical clustering on sales_data_sample.csv dataset. Determine the number of clusters using the elbow method. Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data.
